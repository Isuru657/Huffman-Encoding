# Huffman Encoding
Uses Huffman Encoding to compress textfiles.

File compression compacts the contents of a file (or bunch of files, as when you turn in a zip file of this homework) to save disk space and transfer time. Some compression schemes (like jpeg for images) are lossy, in that they throw away information. Other compression schemes (like zip) are lossless â€” you get back exactly what you put in, but it's just stored in a more compact manner.

Instead of using 7 bits to encode each character, as ASCII does, it uses a variable-length encoding of characters. Frequently occurring characters get shorter code words than infrequently occurring ones. (A code word is the sequence of 0's and 1's used to encode the character.)

Huffman encoding gives the smallest possible fixed encoding of a file. A fixed encoding means that a given letter is represented by the same code wherever it appears in the file.
